## 1. Introduction

**MEOW (Multilayer Encoded Optimized Webfile)** is a Python-based image file format conceived to address the need for an efficient, practical, and cross-platform compatible solution for image storage and manipulation. Born out of a desire for simplicity and modern features, MEOW aims to provide a robust alternative to existing formats, particularly for developers and artists who require transparency, metadata support, and fast rendering capabilities without excessive complexity.

The core philosophy behind MEOW is to balance feature-richness with ease of implementation and use. It is designed to be "the coolest file format there will ever exist," not just in name, but in its practical application and developer-friendliness. This document outlines the current state of the MEOW project, its technical specifications, existing tools, and a comprehensive roadmap for future development, enhancements, and broader ecosystem integration.

## 2. Current Project Status

This section details the project as of its latest stable version (v1.0).

### 2.1 Version & Core Details
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **License:** Apache 2.0 (as per README, though `plans.md` will use MIT as per README's end) - *Correction: README states MIT License at the end. This document will align with MIT.*
*   **License:** MIT License
*   **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS confirmed)
*   **Primary Language:** Python 3.6+

### 2.2 Core Features
*   **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Ensures MEOW files and tools work consistently across major operating systems.
*   **Efficient Binary Storage:** Designed for smaller file sizes compared to uncompressed formats like BMP, and competitive with some compressed formats for certain image types.

*   **Length-Prefixed Metadata:** Simple and effective way to store variable-length metadata strings.
*   **Optimized I/O Operations:** Designed for efficient reading and writing of image files.

## 3. MEOW File Format Specification (v1.0)

The MEOW v1.0 format is designed for simplicity and efficiency.

### 3.1 Header (12 bytes)
*   **Bytes 0-3:** Magic Number - ASCII characters "MEOW". This signature identifies the file as a MEOW image.
*   **Bytes 4-7:** Image Width - A 32-bit unsigned integer (little endian) representing the width of the image in pixels.
*   **Bytes 8-11:** Image Height - A 32-bit unsigned integer (little endian) representing the height of the image in pixels.

### 3.2 Pixel Data
*   **Arrangement:** Immediately follows the header.
*   **Pixel Structure:** Each pixel is represented by 4 bytes, corresponding to Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (RGBA) channels. Each channel is 1 byte (0-255).
*   **Order:** Pixels are stored in row-major order (scanned from left to right, then top to bottom).
*   **Compression:** Uncompressed in v1.0 for simplicity and direct pixel access.
*   **Total Size:** `Width * Height * 4` bytes.

### 3.3 Metadata (Optional)
*   **Placement:** Follows the pixel data block.
*   **Structure:** Consists of one or more length-prefixed strings.
    *   Each metadata entry:
        *   **Length (2 bytes):** A 16-bit unsigned integer (little endian) indicating the length of the metadata string (e.g., "key=value").
        *   **String Data (variable):** The UTF-8 encoded metadata string itself.
*   **Supported Fields (v1.0):**
    *   `creation_date`: ISO 8601 formatted date-time string.
    *   `software`: Name of the software used to create or modify the MEOW file.
*   **Extensibility:** The length-prefixed design allows for future expansion with more metadata fields.

## 6. Setup, Installation & Usage (v1.0)

Guidance on how to get started with MEOW files and tools.

### 6.1 Repository Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MEOW-FILES.git # Replace with actual URL if different

# 2. Navigate to the project directory
cd MEOW-FILES

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` file should primarily list `Pillow` and `NumPy`.

### 6.2 Image Conversion

#### 6.2.1 Using the Command Line (`meow_converter.py`)
*   **Convert standard image (e.g., PNG) to MEOW:**
    ```powershell
    python meow_converter.py compile path/to/your/image.png path/to/output/image.meow
    ```
    If `output/image.meow` is omitted, it typically defaults to the same name as the input with a `.meow` extension.
*   **Convert MEOW back to PNG:**
    ```powershell
    python meow_converter.py extract path/to/your/image.meow path/to/output/image.png
    ```
    If `output/image.png` is omitted, it defaults appropriately.
*   **Display MEOW file information:**
    ```powershell
    python meow_converter.py info path/to/your/image.meow
    ```

#### 6.2.2 Using the GUI Application (`meow_gui.py`)
*   **Launch the application:**
    ```powershell
    python meow_gui.py
    ```
*   **Usage:** The GUI will provide buttons/menus for opening files, selecting conversion options (source and destination formats), and viewing images.

### 6.3 Viewing MEOW Images (`meow_viewer.py`)
*   **Launch the viewer with a specific file:**
    ```powershell
    python meow_viewer.py path/to/your/image.meow
    ```

### 6.4 Quick Launch (Windows - `launch_meow.bat`)
The `launch_meow.bat` script offers convenient ways to interact with MEOW tools on Windows:
*   **Launch the main GUI application:**
    ```powershell
    launch_meow.bat
    ```
*   **Open a MEOW file directly in the viewer:**
    *   Drag and drop a `.meow` file onto the `launch_meow.bat` icon.
    *   Or, via command line:
        ```powershell
        launch_meow.bat path/to/your/image.meow
        ```

### 6.5 Installation as a Package
For easier integration into other Python projects or system-wide availability:
*   **Install directly from a Git repository:**
    ```powershell
    pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/MEOW-FILES.git # Replace with actual URL
    ```
*   **Install in development mode (editable install) from a local clone:**
    ```bash
    # (Ensure you've cloned the repository first)
    cd MEOW-FILES
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This requires a `setup.py` file in the project root.

## 7. Development, Testing & Contribution

### 7.1 Documentation
*   **Primary User Documentation:** `USAGE.md` (located in the repository) provides detailed instructions for users.

*   **This Document (`plans.md`):** Serves as the strategic planning and comprehensive overview document.

### 7.2 Running Tests (`test_meow.py`)
A script, presumably `test_meow.py`, is provided for testing the core functionalities:
```powershell
python test_meow.py
```
This script should cover:
*   Conversion from a sample image (e.g., `test_image.png`) to `.meow` format.
*   Extraction from the generated `.meow` file back to a standard format (e.g., `test_output.png`).
*   Comparison of the original and extracted images to ensure integrity (pixel-wise comparison, metadata check).
*   Testing of the `info` command.

## 8. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

This section outlines the planned evolution of the MEOW format and its ecosystem. The goal is to make MEOW even more versatile, efficient, and widely adopted.

### 8.1 MEOW Format Enhancements (MEOW v2.0 and beyond)

The current v1.0 format is uncompressed. Future versions will introduce more advanced features.

*   **8.1.1 Lossless Compression:**
    *   **Goal:** Reduce file sizes without any loss of image quality.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Integrate standard algorithms like zlib/DEFLATE (similar to PNG).
        *   Explore newer lossless codecs (e.g., Brotli for general data, or image-specific ones if simple enough).
        *   RLE (Run-Length Encoding) for alpha channels or areas with uniform color.
    *   **Format Impact:** New chunk type or flag in the header to indicate compression. Version increment (e.g., MEOW v2.0).

*   **8.1.2 Optional Lossy Compression:**
    *   **Goal:** Offer significantly smaller file sizes for use cases where perfect fidelity is not critical (e.g., web previews).
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based methods (similar to JPEG).
        *   Wavelet compression.
        *   Careful consideration of quality vs. compression ratio settings.
    *   **Format Impact:** New chunk type or flag. Clear distinction from lossless MEOW.

*   **8.1.3 Animation Support (MEOWA - MEOW Animated):**
    *   **Goal:** Enable storing sequences of frames for animations.
    *   **Format Impact:**
        *   Define frame rate, loop counts.
        *   Inter-frame compression techniques (e.g., storing only differences between frames).
        *   New magic number (e.g., "MEWA") or a distinct animation chunk.

*   **8.1.4 Support for Different Color Spaces & Bit Depths:**
    *   **Goal:** Cater to professional workflows and specialized image types.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Grayscale (with and without alpha).
        *   CMYK (for print).
        *   Higher bit depths (e.g., 16-bits per channel for HDR images).
    *   **Format Impact:** Header flags/fields to specify color space and bit depth.

*   **8.1.5 Extended Metadata System:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow for richer, standardized, and custom metadata.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Support for EXIF-like tags (camera settings, geolocation).
        *   IPTC (news photo metadata).
        *   XMP (Adobe's extensible metadata platform).
        *   User-defined key-value pairs with clear namespacing.
    *   **Format Impact:** More structured metadata block, possibly using a chunk-based system within metadata.

*   **8.1.6 Encryption & Password Protection:**
    *   **Goal:** Secure sensitive image content.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   AES encryption for pixel data and/or metadata.
        *   Password-derived keys.
    *   **Format Impact:** Flags and fields for encryption parameters.

*   **8.1.7 Chunk-Based Format for Progressive Loading & Extensibility:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow for displaying a low-resolution version of an image while it's still downloading. Improve format flexibility.
    *   **Methods:** Similar to PNG's chunk system (IHDR, PLTE, IDAT, IEND, etc.).
        *   `MHDR` (MEOW Header Chunk) - containing magic, version, width, height, compression, etc.
        *   `MDAT` (MEOW Pixel Data Chunk) - can be split for progressive loading.
        *   `META` (MEOW Metadata Chunk) - for various metadata types.
        *   `ANIM` (MEOW Animation Control Chunk).
    *   **Format Impact:** Major redesign, likely MEOW v2.0 or v3.0. This would be a foundational change for many other enhancements.

*   **8.1.8 Palette Support / Indexed Color:**
    *   **Goal:** Significantly reduce file size for images with a limited number of colors (e.g., icons, simple graphics).
    *   **Format Impact:** New color type in header, palette chunk (`MPLT`?), pixel data stores indices into the palette.
