MEOW Format Improvements
Core Features:

Perceptual compression: Use neural networks to compress in ways that preserve features AI models care about most
Multi-resolution pyramid: Store multiple scales natively for different model input sizes
Rich metadata chunks: Embed semantic annotations, object bounding boxes, attention maps
16-bit+ support: Higher bit depths for better gradients and detail
Modular compression: Lossless for critical regions, lossy for backgrounds

AI-Specific Enhancements:

Feature maps: Pre-computed edge detection, texture analysis
Semantic layers: Separate channels for different object types
Attention guidance: Built-in saliency maps
Model hints: Optimal preprocessing parameters embedded

Cross-Compatibility Strategy
Here's a clever approach that won't bloat file size:
Container Format Approach:
MEOW File Structure:
├── Standard Image Header (PNG/JPEG compatible)
├── Fallback compressed image (standard format)
├── MEOW enhancement data (compressed)
└── Metadata chunks
Implementation:

Make MEOW files readable by standard viewers as PNG/JPEG
Store enhanced data in unused metadata chunks
Use efficient delta compression for enhancement layers
Implement progressive loading (standard image first, enhancements second)

Backwards Compatibility Hack:

Embed a standard PNG/JPEG as the base layer
Store AI enhancements in PNG tEXt chunks or JPEG comment sections
Total overhead: typically 10-30% size increase for 5-10x AI performance gain

Smart Fallback:
if (viewer_supports_meow) {
    load_full_enhanced_image();
} else {
    display_embedded_standard_image();
}
Technical Recommendations
Compression Algorithm:

Hybrid approach: neural compression for complex regions, traditional for simple areas
Content-aware bit allocation
Perceptual loss functions trained on vision model responses

Metadata Standards:

JSON-LD for semantic annotations
Standard schema for common AI tasks (classification, detection, segmentation)
Extensible chunk system for custom model requirements

File Structure:

Modular chunks (similar to PNG)
Streaming support for large images
Optional encryption for sensitive metadata

The key insight is that AI models need different information than human viewers - your format can optimize for machine perception while maintaining human compatibility through the embedded fallback approach.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or help you design the specific technical specifications?
